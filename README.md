## Todo List Application  
This personal project is to design and build an independent window-based ToDo List manager. This application can store lists between program executions. The motivation of this application is to make it easier for people to manage and record all tasks, allowing users to respond to each task more quickly.

## Tests
The test part uses Junit unit test. During this period, I followed the TDD method, first constructed the test method, and then completed the corresponding source code.  
During this period, I used JAVA throughout. Since this project only requires MVP features, I have completed testing all the situations I can think of. (Remove getter, setter and all constructors)
